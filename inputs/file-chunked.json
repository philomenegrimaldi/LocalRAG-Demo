The Master Printer's Analysis (Conclusion)\n\nOctober was a productive month.\n\n1. Trend: Demand for C-41 (color) and RC Pearl paper is clearly increasing.\n\n2. Watch Point: Our Rapid Fixer stock is dwindling faster than expected. A bulk order must be placed for November to avoid a shortage.\n\n3. Suggestion: Water consumption for washing Fiber Base papers is significant. A reminder to all staff to optimize washing cycles."
