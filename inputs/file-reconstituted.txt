The Silver Halide Workshop - October 2025

Prepared by: The Master Chemist

Attention: The Team

Welcome to the backstage of magic! Every perfect print, every successfully developed negative, comes at a material cost. This report doesn't smell like fixer (lucky for you), but it details everything our darkroom consumed this month.

-------------------------------------------------------------
1. The Liquid Magic: Chemical Consumption

The heart of our craft. This is where the latent image becomes visible. Consumption was steady, with a spike in C-41 color developing, a sure sign that the summer holidays are being processed!

2. Where the Image Comes to Life: Photosensitive Papers

 | Fiber Base (Baryta) Paper |  |  | Glossy |  |  | 35 m² |

-------------------------------------------------------------
We "burned" through an impressive amount of paper this month. Pearl finish seems to be the favorite among our artists.

Printer's Note: The matte fiber-base paper was mainly used for the "Urban Contrasts" exhibition. The results are stunning, but the wash time (and thus water consumption) must be factored in.

3. The Unsung Heroes of the Dark (Utilities & Safety)

Table 4e7aa9c8f917e3f0a8a8cf4d50aefe1f (fitz version):
• 
Deionized Water: 500 Liters 
Use: Mixing all stock chemistries. 
This guarantees the purity of our 
baths. 
• 
Nitrile Gloves: 4 Boxes (approx. 
400 pairs) 
Use: Protection from reagents. 
Safety first! 
 
• 
Safelights (Red Bulbs): 2 
replacements 
Use: Seeing in the dark without 
fogging the paper. 
• 
Carbon Filters (Ventilation): 1 
replacement cycle 
Use: Keeping the workshop air 
breathable. 
• 
Negative Sleeves: 600 units 
Use: Protecting client negatives.

-------------------------------------------------------------
These are the workshop's unsung heroes. Without them, we'd have no clean prints and very sore hands!

Carbon Filters (Ventilation): 1

Use: Protecting client negatives.

4. The Master Printer's Analysis (Conclusion)

October was a productive month.

1. Trend: Demand for C-41 (color) and RC Pearl paper is clearly increasing.

2. Watch Point: Our Rapid Fixer stock is dwindling faster than expected. A bulk order must be placed for November to avoid a shortage.

3. Suggestion: Water consumption for washing Fiber Base papers is significant. A reminder to all staff to optimize washing cycles.
